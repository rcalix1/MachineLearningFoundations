## Understanding Why Gaussian NB Replaces Word Counts

This expands the intuition behind why Gaussian NB is used for continuous features.

### Case 1: Text Classification (Multinomial NB)

With word counts, we estimate probabilities using frequencies:

P(w_i | c) = count(w_i in class c) / total words in class c

Simple counting works because features are discrete.

### Case 2: Continuous Features

Example feature vector:
[5.4, 2.1, 1.3, 0.2]

You cannot count how often 5.4 appears—continuous values almost never repeat.
So instead of frequencies, you must use a probability density model.

Naive Bayes still assumes:


$$
P(x \mid c) = \prod_{j=1}^{d} P(x_j \mid c)
$$


But each 



$$
P(x_j \mid c)
$$

must now handle real numbers.

### Gaussian = Continuous Equivalent of Counting

We assume:


$$
x_j \mid c \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{c,j},\, \sigma_{c,j}^2)
$$


So instead of counting, we compute mean & variance and evaluate:





$$
P(x_j \mid c)=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{c,j}^2}}
\exp\left(
-\frac{(x_j - \mu_{c,j})^2}{2\sigma_{c,j}^2}
\right)
$$



Same purpose as word likelihoods, just adapted for continuous data.

### Key Insight

YES — Gaussian NB is the continuous analogue of Multinomial NB.

* Words → counts → categorical probabilities
* Continuous → mean/variance → Gaussian densities

Both compute:
P(c) * Π_j P(x_j | c)




$$
P(c) \times \prod_{j} P(x_j \mid c)
$$



Only the form of  

$P(x_j \mid c)$

changes.


### Final Translation Table

| Discrete Words      | Continuos features       |       |                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Count word frequencies        | Compute mean & variance      |       |                  |
| Categorical probability table | Gaussian probability density |       |                  |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes       | Gaussian Naive Bayes         |       |                  |
| P(w_i / c) from counts        |  P(x_j / c) from Gaussian    |

They are structurally identical; only the likelihood model changes.

# 1. Multinomial Naive Bayes (Text / Word Counts)

Multinomial NB is used when features are **counts** (e.g., word counts).

### Key idea

* Estimate **P(word | class)** from word frequencies.
* Multiply all word likelihoods with the class prior.

### Minimal Example (Toy)

```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
import numpy as np

def train_multinomial(docs, labels):
    classes = set(labels)
    priors = {}
    word_counts = {c: Counter() for c in classes}
    total_words = {c: 0 for c in classes}

    for doc, c in zip(docs, labels):
        priors[c] = priors.get(c, 0) + 1
        for w in doc:
            word_counts[c][w] += 1
            total_words[c] += 1

    total_docs = len(docs)
    for c in priors:
        priors[c] /= total_docs

    return classes, priors, word_counts, total_words


def predict_multinomial(doc, classes, priors, word_counts, total_words):
    scores = {}
    for c in classes:
        log_prob = np.log(priors[c])
        for w in doc:
            # Laplace smoothing
            count_w = word_counts[c][w] + 1
            denom = total_words[c] + len(word_counts[c])
            log_prob += np.log(count_w / denom)
        scores[c] = log_prob
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)

# Example usage
X = [["cat", "sat", "mat"], ["dog", "ran"], ["cat", "ran"]]
y = [0, 1, 0]
classes, priors, wc, totals = train_multinomial(X, y)
print(predict_multinomial(["cat"], classes, priors, wc, totals))
```

# 2. Gaussian Naive Bayes (Continuous Features)

Used when features are **real-valued numbers**, not counts.

### Key idea

* Each feature is modeled with a **Gaussian distribution per class**.
* Compute:

  * mean per class per feature
  * variance per class per feature
  * prior probability of each class
* Evaluate Gaussian PDF at test time.

### Minimal Example (Toy)

```python
import numpy as np

# Gaussian PDF
def gaussian_pdf(x, mean, var):
    return (1.0 / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * var)) * np.exp(- (x - mean)**2 / (2 * var))


def train_gaussian(X, y):
    classes = np.unique(y)
    n_classes = len(classes)
    n_features = X.shape[1]

    means = np.zeros((n_classes, n_features))
    vars_ = np.zeros((n_classes, n_features))
    priors = np.zeros(n_classes)

    for idx, c in enumerate(classes):
        Xc = X[y == c]
        means[idx] = Xc.mean(axis=0)
        vars_[idx] = Xc.var(axis=0)
        priors[idx] = len(Xc) / len(X)

    return classes, means, vars_, priors


def predict_gaussian(x, classes, means, vars_, priors):
    posteriors = []
    for idx, c in enumerate(classes):
        prior = np.log(priors[idx])
        likelihood = np.sum(np.log(gaussian_pdf(x, means[idx], vars_[idx])))
        posteriors.append(prior + likelihood)
    return classes[np.argmax(posteriors)]

# Example usage
X = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [1.1, 1.9], [5.0, 6.0], [5.2, 5.9]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
classes, means, vars_, priors = train_gaussian(X, y)
print(predict_gaussian(np.array([1.05, 2.1]), classes, means, vars_, priors))
```

# 3. Core Insight: Why They Look Different

| Text NB (Multinomial)                | Continuous NB (Gaussian)           |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Uses **counts**                      | Uses **real numbers**              |
| Likelihood from **frequency tables** | Likelihood from **Gaussian PDF**   |
| (P(w \mid c)) from counting words    | (P(x \mid c)) from mean & variance |
| Works on bag-of-words                | Works on numeric features          |

Both share the **same structure**:



$$
P(c) \times \prod_{j} P(x_j \mid c)
$$


Only the **form of the likelihood** changes.

---

# 4. Summary

* If features are **counts** → use Multinomial NB.
* If features are **continuous real values** → use Gaussian NB.
* Both rely on the Naive Bayes independence assumption.
* Both compute **log posteriors** to avoid numerical underflow.

## Simple Example: One Feature, Two Classes

Suppose we are classifying apples:

Class A: small apples

Class B: large apples

Feature = weight in grams (continuous)

### You measure some apples and compute:

Class A

mean weight: 100 g

variance: 10²

Class B

mean weight: 200 g

variance: 20²

So we model:

Weight of class A apples ~ Normal(100, 10²)

Weight of class B apples ~ Normal(200, 20²)

This is exactly what your code does: compute means and variances per class.

Now you get a new apple weighing 120 g.

You want:

What is the probability this weight would come from class A vs class B?

Since weight is continuous, you cannot count frequencies — almost no apple weighs exactly 120g.

# Simple Gaussian Naive Bayes Example

A minimal, fully runnable example showing **why the Gaussian formula gives a valid likelihood** for a continuous feature.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

When features are **continuous** (like weight, height, temperature), you **cannot count frequencies** the way you do for text.

So Naive Bayes assumes each feature is drawn from a **Gaussian distribution**:

$$
x_j \mid c \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{c,j},,\sigma_{c,j}^2)
$$

Then the likelihood for a new value is computed using the Gaussian PDF:

$$
P(x_j \mid c)=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_{c,j}^2}}
\exp\left(
-\frac{(x_j - \mu_{c,j})^2}{2\sigma_{c,j}^2}
\right)
$$

---

# ✅ Super Simple Working Code Example

This example proves why the Gaussian gives a meaningful probability.

We classify apples based on **weight**.

```python
import numpy as np

# ---- Gaussian PDF ----
def gaussian_pdf(x, mean, var):
    return (1 / np.sqrt(2*np.pi*var)) * np.exp(- (x - mean)**2 / (2*var))

# ---- Example data ----
# Class A: small apples
mean_A, var_A = 100, 10**2

# Class B: large apples
mean_B, var_B = 200, 20**2

# New apple weight
x = 120

# ---- Likelihoods ----
p_x_given_A = gaussian_pdf(x, mean_A, var_A)
p_x_given_B = gaussian_pdf(x, mean_B, var_B)

print("P(x=120 | Class A) =", p_x_given_A)
print("P(x=120 | Class B) =", p_x_given_B)
```

### ✅ Expected Output

```
P(x=120 | Class A) ≈ 0.0054
P(x=120 | Class B) ≈ 0.0000012
```

---

# 🎯 Interpretation

* **120g is close to Class A's mean (100g)** → Gaussian returns a **higher** likelihood.
* **120g is far from Class B's mean (200g)** → Gaussian returns a **tiny** likelihood.

This is exactly how Naive Bayes handles continuous features.

### Final takeaway:

**The Gaussian replaces word-count probabilities by giving the likelihood of a continuous value under each class.**

# Simple Example: Why Multiplication Becomes Addition When Using Logs

This README shows a **tiny, runnable Python example** that demonstrates how
multiplying probabilities is equivalent to **adding their logs**.



---

# ✅ Intuition

Small probabilities multiply into even smaller numbers.
Logs prevent underflow by turning:

```
a * b * c
```

into

```
log(a) + log(b) + log(c)
```

Both methods give the **same ordering**, and the log version is numerically safer.

---

# ✅ Fully Runnable Example

We have two classes, and we compute which class is more likely using:

* direct multiplication
* log + addition

Both will pick the same class.

```python
import numpy as np

# Pretend these are likelihoods for three features under two classes
# Class A probabilities
A = [0.2, 0.5, 0.1]

# Class B probabilities
B = [0.3, 0.4, 0.05]

# ---- Method 1: Multiply directly ----
prod_A = np.prod(A)
prod_B = np.prod(B)

print("Direct multiply:")
print("A:", prod_A)
print("B:", prod_B)

# ---- Method 2: Use logs (sum of logs) ----
log_A = np.sum(np.log(A))
log_B = np.sum(np.log(B))

print("\nUsing logs:")
print("A:", log_A)
print("B:", log_B)

# ---- Compare decisions ----
print("\nClass chosen (multiply):", "A" if prod_A > prod_B else "B")
print("Class chosen (log):", "A" if log_A > log_B else "B")
```

---

# ✅ Expected Output (approx.)

```
Direct multiply:
A: 0.010
B: 0.006

Using logs:
A: -4.605
B: -5.115

Class chosen (multiply): A
Class chosen (log): A
```

---

# 🎯 Takeaway

* Multiplying three small numbers gives **tiny results**.
* Taking logs turns multiplication into **addition**, avoiding tiny values.
* The **final comparison is identical**.

This is why Naive Bayes—and many other ML methods—use log-probabilities.
